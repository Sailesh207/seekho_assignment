This is a Simple Application that shows a list of anime series and when you click on any of the anime item, it will basically display the details
of that particular anime.

-> So I have two activities and two ViewModel. One for Main Screen and other for Details Screen
-> For Architecture I used MVVM
-> For making api calls I used retrofit
-> Then finally for dealing with the anime list view, I used recyclerView.
